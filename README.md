# Jumia exercise

# Doubts

- Why use API, what is the need?

# TODO

- Pass the logic to the reducer - optimization and better coding. (instad of passing the copy the entire list of tasks, just add or remove directly on the state)

- Add tests

# EXTRA

- Add dragable to change the position from the tasks
